# Universal-Remote-Controller

### This project basically has the Android App implementation to interface an Android Phone with an Arduino Chip having IR led configuration to control any Home Appliance.

### The Interfacing between Android Mobile Phone and Arduino Chip is done using Bluetooth.

### The Android Mobile App basically accepts commands from the User using Voice and accepts very simple commands like "Switch on the AC", or "Switch on the TV" , etc.

### This Repo also contains the Arduino Chip Code used to control the IR LEDs attached to it which basically sends the respective IR signal to the intended device based on the Voice input from the user on the Android Phone.
